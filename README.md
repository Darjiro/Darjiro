# Hi! I'm Andy (@Darjiro) 👋

### Backend Developer | Passionate about DevOps and Automation 🚀

<br/>

I am a 24-year-old developer with a strong focus on the **backend**. My experience is based on building **complex personal projects from start to finish**, from API and database design to final deployment in production. I specialize in creating robust and scalable applications, and I enjoy managing the infrastructure needed to get them up and running.

- 🌱 Currently exploring microservices architectures and improving my CI/CD practices.
- 💞️ Open to collaborating on open-source projects or innovative startups, especially if they involve Python or cloud technologies.
- 📫 You can contact me through the badges at the end of this profile.
